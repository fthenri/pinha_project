# Online Collaborative Board

Welcome to the **Online Collaborative Board**, a Django-based web application where users can login and collaboratively change the color of small squares on a grid, creating artwork together in real-time!

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: The board is divided into small squares, which users can click to change the color.
- **User Authentication**: Users must sign up and login to change the colors of the squares.
- **Public View**: Unauthenticated users can view the board but need to sign up or log in to participate in painting.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Anyone can log in and contribute to the evolving artwork.

## Installation
