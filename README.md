# Pinha - Collaborative Board Painting

Welcome to the **Pinha**, a Django-based web application where users can login and collaboratively change the color of small squares on a grid, creating artwork together in real-time!

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: The board is divided into small squares, which users can click to change the color.
- **User Authentication**: Users must sign up and login to change the colors of the squares.
- **Public View**: Unauthenticated users can view the board but need to sign up or log in to participate in painting.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Anyone can log in and contribute to the evolving artwork.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fthenri/pinha_project.git
   cd pinha
   ```
   
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Django development server**:

   ```

6. **Access the application**: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
